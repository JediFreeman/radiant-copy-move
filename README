This extension adds a new action ('CopyMove') in the Radiant's administration interface near the 'Add child' button. With this extension you can copy or move a page (and all of its children).

== Requirements

You need the shards extension for this to work. See http://groups.google.com/group/radiantcms-dev/browse_frm/thread/d07f7fffd84b3ce0/5efa6fd6c2e1668e?lnk=gst&q=shards#5efa6fd6c2e1668e

== Installation

Get the latest version of CopyMove extension code:

	svn co http://dev.gravityblast.com/svn/projects/radiant/extensions/copy_move/
	
From your Rails app root type this command:

  rake RAILS_ENV=production radiant:extensions:copy_move:install

Which will copy some needed files to the public directory of your app.
